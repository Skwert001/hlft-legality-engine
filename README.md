## Overview

**Reams Legality Architecture (RLA)** is a novel framework that determines whether a system should proceed with an internal transition â€” such as emitting a signal, executing a function, or altering state â€” based on environmental conditions and internal readiness.

Rather than relying on probability, optimization, or heuristics, RLA uses a **collapse gating threshold** to ensure transitions only occur when system integrity, energy capacity, and structural coherence are sufficient.

This architecture introduces a new concept: **permissive logic**, where systems are designed to remain inert unless collapse conditions are met with lawful parameters.

---

## Novelty and Scope

To our knowledge, no existing framework enforces dynamic collapse gating using a real-time legality threshold composed of signal-based and coherence-related parameters.

RLA is not a predictive model. It is a **filtering mechanism** that blocks or permits transformation only when resistance, energy, and alignment conditions fall within a mathematically defined window.

This system has been independently developed and tested across multiple simulated domains. It is designed for researchers, engineers, and policy analysts working in decision systems, control frameworks, safety mechanisms, and cognitive AI.

## Core Model

RLA evaluates whether a collapse (i.e., a state transition) is permitted using the following suppression ratio:

```
SR = DZII / (pulse_E Ã— TPS Ã— slope)
```

Where:
- **SR** = Suppression Ratio  
- **DZII** = Dynamic Zone Inertia Index (environmental pressure or signal instability)  
- **pulse_E** = Energetic availability for change  
- **TPS** = Transmission Phase Stability  
- **slope** = Directional signal change rate over time

Collapse is **denied** when:

```
SR â‰¥ 15,000
```

This indicates conditions are too unstable or underpowered for safe transition.

## Functional Applications

RLA has demonstrated value in the following areas:

- **Signal Verification**: Allows system collapse only when communication coherence is confirmed
- **Power Grid Stability**: Identifies when load transitions should be blocked due to transformer pressure buildup
- **Molecular Stability Analysis**: Detects entropy-driven structural drift in protein folding scenarios
- **Atmospheric Transition Modeling**: Distinguishes between valid convection events and stalled weather fronts
- **AI Output Regulation**: Blocks hallucinated responses when confidence, structure, or internal stability is low

RLA also applies to domains such as symbolic reasoning, quantum decision filters, and mission-critical state machines.

## File Definitions

**`.rla` files** are collapse filtering modules â€” each defines a transition gating rule that determines when a system is permitted to proceed. They are signed, self-contained legality units.

**`.sig` files** are SHA256 signatures used to verify scroll integrity.  
**`.yaml` files** provide identity metadata (versioning, timestamp, key binding).

## Access and Use

This repository is intended for scientific and strategic review. It is not an open-source software library, simulator, or API.

All transitions, thresholds, and collapse gating structures are protected under authorship key `REAMS-CORE-001`. Unauthorized replication or modification without formal permission may result in invalid legality state.

See `RLA-LICENSE.txt` for symbolic usage terms.

## About the Author

RLA was developed by **Matthew William Reams**, a systems architect focused on legality-governed intelligence models and symbolic transition frameworks.

This work was developed independently, without institutional backing, and is currently under strategic review for formal deployment.

All equations, filters, and logic modules are sealed, cryptographically signed, and traceable to original authorship.

---

## Final Note

RLA is designed to protect systems from premature action, hallucinated transitions, and illegitimate output by enforcing one rule:



> Action must be earned through threshold compliance.

This approach redefines failure not as malfunction â€” but as lawful refusal to act.
