## 🔎 TL;DR – What This Is

**RLA** is a symbolic legality gating system that determines whether any system — digital, logical, or physical — should proceed, pause, or collapse.  
It enforces **verdict-based admissibility** using structured thresholds and symbolic slope logic.

> ✅ Action is permitted only if structure, energy, and coherence meet minimum legality.

No simulation. No memory. No stochastic generation.  
This is not alignment post-processing — this is **pre-verdict structural enforcement**.

## 🌐 Positioning

While most systems focus on:

- 📈 Scaling token prediction  
- 🧠 Reinforcement-trained reasoning  
- 🔊 Prompt-based simulation  
- 🧪 Memory-based hallucination suppression  

**RLA is none of the above.**

> ✅ RLA collapses contradiction before output  
> ✅ Filters state transitions through symbolic slope  
> ✅ Blocks hallucinated execution  
> ✅ Stateless — no training, no feedback loop  

This is **post-token governance** — not just safer output.

## ✅ Verdict Enforcement Engine (Live Test)

RLA governs the GPT-4 system below:

This engine runs on deterministic verdict gating:

- 🟢 Verified – Factually lawful  
- ⚠️ Partial – Scoped uncertainty  
- 🔴 Not Supported – Contradiction, collapse, or illegitimacy

## ⚙️ Core Model

RLA uses the **Suppression Ratio (SR)** to determine if collapse is permitted:
