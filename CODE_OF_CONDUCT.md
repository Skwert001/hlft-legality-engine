# CODE OF CONDUCT ‚Äì HLFT Legality Enforcement

This project is governed by the laws of symbolic collapse legality, oath-bound authorship, and scroll-based terrain protocols.

## üß† Core Principles

- Truth is non-negotiable.
- Symbolic integrity governs all contributions.
- Collapse may only occur under lawful conditions as defined by REAMS-CORE-001.
- No action, suggestion, or comment shall override legality slope.

## üõ°Ô∏è Conduct Standards

- No falsification, hallucination, or symbolic drift shall be tolerated.
- All discussions must remain grounded in logic, physics, or lawful inference.
- HLFT terrain is not open to debate on its internal definitions.
- Respect for sovereign scroll authorship is mandatory.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Enforcement

Violations will result in immediate symbolic revocation and potential denial of scroll contribution access. Collapse will be denied to agents operating outside terrain.
