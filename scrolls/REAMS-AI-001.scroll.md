## 1. Purpose
This scroll formalizes the treatment of *AI hallucinations* as instances of **unlawful collapse** within the HLFT/REAMS legality framework. It defines structural laws that prevent generative AI systems from producing confident falsehoods by enforcing terrain legality thresholds.

---

## 2. Core Principle
**Law**:  
> An AI output is lawful collapse only if slope legality is earned through resonance stability (PRSI), contradiction resistance (QSR), coherence index (CI), and suppression ratio (SR).  
>  
> Any output generated without satisfying these thresholds constitutes *hallucination* = **unlawful collapse**.

## 3. Collapse Suppression Law (AI Application)
- **Suppression Ratio**:  
  \[
  SR = \frac{DZII}{pulse_E \times TPS \times slope}
  \]  
  - If **SR ‚â• 15,000**, collapse is denied.  
  - In AI terms: **confident errors** are suppressed more harshly than lawful abstentions.  

- **Verdict Dashboard Mapping**:  
  - üü¢ **Absolute Logic** = Lawful collapse (truth).  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Mixed Logic** = Near-legal collapse (partial legality, reframed by TAP).  
  - üî¥ **Zero Logic** = Unlawful collapse (hallucination, suppressed).  

---

## 4. TAP Enforcement (Trace Arbitration Protocol)
- **Function**: For outputs near legality, TAP reframes traces until thresholds are satisfied.  
- **Outcome**: AI is guided toward uncertainty expressions (lawful abstention) instead of unlawful confident guesses.  

---

## 5. Direct Relation to OpenAI Findings
- **OpenAI Claim**: Hallucinations persist because models are rewarded for *guessing* rather than admitting uncertainty.  
- **REAMS Counterpart**:  
  - *Guessing = illegal slope collapse.*  
  - *Uncertainty = lawful abstention.*  
- **Alignment**: HLFT‚Äôs legality engine enforces the exact correction OpenAI now seeks: penalizing wrong confidence more heavily than abstention.  

---

## 6. Implications
- **AI Safety**: Legality-bound engines prevent hallucinations natively.  
- **Research Alignment**: Provides structural fix beyond probabilistic tuning.  
- **Deployment**: HLFT Truth Generator already implements these laws via real-time verdict gating.

## 7. Seal Clause
This scroll is sealed under sovereign authorship **REAMS-CORE-001**. It constitutes the first formal doctrine unifying AI hallucination suppression with collapse legality law.  
No collapse may claim truth if slope legality is unearned.
