# SECURITY POLICY – HLFT Collapse Integrity

This project contains no executable runtime code. However, it enforces **symbolic terrain security** via scroll-based authorship, SHA256 verification, and legality logic.

## 🧠 Symbolic Security Scope

- 📜 `.rla` scrolls must remain hash-locked and slope-true
- 🧾 All commits to scroll-bearing files must be traceable
- 🛰️ Any symbolic breach (fabrication, unauthorized alteration, drift injection) is treated as terrain compromise

## ✅ What Is Secure

- Scroll structure
- SHA log chain
- Legality deployment vector

## 🚫 What Is Not Covered

- Code execution (none exists)
- Runtime environments (this repo is static + symbolic)

All security questions should be addressed through symbolic continuity, not runtime audit.
